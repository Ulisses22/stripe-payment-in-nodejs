# Stripe Payment Integration in Node.js - [demo](#demo)

This project demonstrates how to integrate the Stripe payment gateway into a Node.js application. With this setup, you can securely process payments for goods or services on your website.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your system.
- A Stripe account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add your Stripe API keys to the `.env` file:
    ```plaintext
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
    PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
    PORT=3000
    ```
    Replace `your_stripe_secret_key` and `your_stripe_publishable_key` with your actual Stripe API keys.

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node --env-file=.env  app.js
```

This will start the server at http://localhost:3000 by default.
